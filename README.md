# Cutis

Cutis ("Comfortable UTIs") is a thin Swift wrapper on top of the UTI (Universal Type Identifier) C API.

Apart from providing a typesafe and object-oriented wrapper around type identifiers, Cutis does the heavy lifting for you by taking care of the casting required when interacting with CoreFoundation-style APIs.

If you deal a lot with type identifiers in your project, Cutis can make your code simpler and easier to follow.
